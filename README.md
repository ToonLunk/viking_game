This is my first game ever. As I learn more, I will add more to the game.

The now playable section (cross_a_river) is only one of many sections.

Right now, I have figured out how to choose a random function from a [list]. However, I want the player's strength and XP level to affect which option is more likely to happen. If anyone could let me know, I would greatly appreciate it.
